## üöÄ About The Project

This project is an ambitious endeavor to build a scalable and immersive platform for interacting with specialized 3D AI assistants. Inspired by industry leaders like Soul Machines, the goal is to move beyond simple text-based chatbots and create emotionally resonant, interactive digital humans for a variety of use cases.

The user experience is paramount, featuring a stunning, performant 3D hero section, a dynamic gallery of configurable avatars, and a real-time, streaming chat interface that brings the characters to life.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Real-time Conversational AI:** Live, streaming chat powered by the **Google Gemini API** and the Vercel AI SDK.
*   **Interactive 3D Hero:** A performant, full-screen hero section built with React Three Fiber, featuring a multi-character composition, scroll-based parallax animations, dramatic neon lighting, and post-processing effects.
*   **Dynamic Avatar Gallery:** A fully configurable system for displaying specialized assistants in a "Featured" carousel and a "Popular" grid, with unique themes, fonts, and colors defined per character.
*   **Live 3D Preview:** An on-demand, accessible modal that allows users to inspect the full 3D model of an assistant with orbit controls.
*   **Real-time Lip-Sync:** The 3D avatar's mouth animates in real-time as the AI assistant "speaks," creating a more immersive and believable interaction.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Built on the **Next.js 14 App Router**, with a clean separation between performant Server Components and interactive Client Components.
*   **Polished UX:** Fluid, 60fps animations throughout, including smooth page scrolling via Lenis, parallax effects, and interactive UI elements powered by Framer Motion.

## üîÆ Future Scope (Roadmap)

This project has a rich roadmap for future development, transforming it from a powerful demo into a full-featured platform.

*   **Enhanced Speech & Animation:**
    *   [ ] Integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service (e.g., ElevenLabs) to give the avatars a real voice.
    *   [ ] Refine lip-syncing to be driven by audio phonemes for higher accuracy.
    *   [ ] Trigger a wider range of facial expressions and idle body animations based on the AI's emotional sentiment.
*   **User & Database Integration:**
    *   [ ] Implement user authentication with NextAuth.js to allow for personalized experiences.
    *   [ ] Connect a database (e.g., Vercel Postgres) to save user conversation histories.
*   **Platform Features:**
    *   [ ] Build a search and filter system for the avatar gallery based on tags and categories.
    *   [ ] Develop a "Studio" page where users could potentially customize an avatar's appearance or personality (system prompt).
*   **Voice Input:**
    *   [ ] Integrate a Speech-to-Text (STT) service (e.g., the browser's Web Speech API or OpenAI's Whisper) to allow users to speak directly to the assistants.
