## üöÄ About The Project

AVA.AI is an ambitious, scalable, and immersive platform for interacting with specialized 3D AI assistants. Inspired by industry leaders like Soul Machines, our mission transcends text-based chatbots and aims to create emotionally resonant, interactive digital humans.

This project is a comprehensive full-stack showcase, merging modern 3D rendering, advanced state management, real-time AI/TTS integration, and sophisticated, responsive UI/UX. With a cost-free "Demo Mode" (pre-scripted interactions and pre-recorded voice) to showcase its capabilities, AVA.AI redefines interactive digital assistants for a wide range of use cases and platforms.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Conversational AI:** Live, streaming chat powered by Google Gemini API, orchestrated by a custom `useAvatarChat` hook on top of the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Advanced 3D Animation System:**
  - Full Body Animations with robust state machine: seamless transitions between Idle, Thinking, and randomized Talking.
  - Procedural, natural blinking makes avatars feel alive.
  - AI-Driven Expressions: Emotional signals parsed from the AI's response drive morph-target facial animation.
- **Full-Duplex Voice Interaction:**
  - Text-to-Speech: High-quality, sequential voice output by ElevenLabs API.
  - Audio-Driven Lip-Sync: Real-time lip movement synchronized to streamed TTS audio.
  - Speech-to-Text: Voice input via Web Speech API, intelligently managing state, mute/unmute, and maintaining transcript context.
- **Interactive 3D Hero:** A multi-character, full-screen 3D hero section in React Three Fiber, featuring parallax, neon lighting, and post-processing.
- **Dynamic Avatar Galleries:** Configurable carousels ("Featured"), grid layouts ("Popular"), and modal 3D previews.
- **Sophisticated & Responsive Architecture:**
  - Dual-mode chat: Professional 2-column chat on desktop, fullscreen voice-first experience on mobile.
  - Fast Next.js App Router with performant Server Components and rich, interactive Client Components.
- **Cost-Free "Demo Mode":** Showcases full animation and speech capabilities without live API usage, using pre-recorded content.
- **Polished UX:** 60fps animations, smooth page transitions (Lenis), interactive UI elements (Framer Motion).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Data Flow

The platform leverages a decoupled, modern architecture separating data-fetching/SEO (Server Components) from rich client-side interaction (Client Components). State is centrally managed with Zustand, ensuring reliable coordination between AI responses, audio playback, 3D animation, and UI.
